# Tmux dotfile
:toc:

## Usage
To use it's straight simple. Run:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/BenjamimCS/dotfile-tmux.git
# or
git clone --depth 1 --no-single-branch https://github.com/BenjamimCS/dotfile-tmux.git \
./configure.sh
```
The script will make the things for you.

The script presents you with two options:
* override the `~/.tmux.conf`
* keep it but moving it to other name (appending `.old` to it)
